      <h1>Meet Hannah Applegate</h1>
      <p> My name is Hannah Applegate, born and raised in West Valley City, Utah. I grew up loving art and found joy in any kind of medium I could get my hands on. I've been doing photography since I was around fouteen years old. I love working in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, and dabble a bit in both traditional and digital drawing. Along with photography, I love printmaking, painting, and writing. I currently work for Intermountain Health in the supply chain sector while I attend Salt Lake Community College for a degree in Web Design.</p>
